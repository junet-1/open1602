// The original plans a ship's course in a square window around the ship (161 x 161 tiles for an
// ordinary order, 0x00455A20) with the wavefront of the land figures: open sea and the water tiles
// inside an island's rectangle are sailable, coast, beach, surf, piers and buildings are not, other
// ships nearby are blocked out as 3 x 3 squares. A target further away than the window is reached in
// legs through the window edge closest to it. The course is stored as runs of one or two tiles in one
// of eight directions.
//
// Open1602 runs an exact Dijkstra on the same integer costs (64 straight, 91 diagonal, no cut
// corners) with a fixed neighbour order, so the result is the same on every computer (ADR 0004).
// Cells outside the world are blocked; the original leaves them open (S-070).
