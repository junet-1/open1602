// Every crop is three consecutive records of haeuser.cod: growing (HAUS_PRODTYP Kind ROHSTWACHS),
// ripe (ROHSTOFF, with the ware a worker harvests) and, for fields, withered. A growing tile has
// a growth entry; 32 global clocks, one per growth class, tick every 40 s + 7 s * class, and each
// tick moves the entries of that class one stage on (the tile's animation phase shows the stage).
// After AnimAnz stages the tile becomes its ripe record. Harvesting turns it back into the
// growing record with a new entry (0x0047CA80, 0x0047C830).
