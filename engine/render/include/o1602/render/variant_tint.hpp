// Art in any player colour from art drawn in a few. The original draws some interface pictures
// once per player colour (coats of arms, message icons: red, blue, yellow, white); a banner
// without its own drawn variant gets the white one recoloured. What belongs to the colour is
// found by comparing the variants: where they all differ is cloth, where they agree (the lips of
// a message icon, outlines, the selection frame) stays as drawn. Cloth is shaded like the generic
// flag (flag_tint.hpp), so a banner's art and its flag have the same colour; the shading may come
// from another variant, so that a further banner shows the cross, the quarters or the stripes of
// one of the original coats of arms in its own colour.
